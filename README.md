# SQL-Project-3-Data-Cleaning

This project focuses on cleaning data using various SQL queries.

# Key Changes Made
- Removing Duplicates

Then we did a bit of exploratory data analysis like:
- Maximum total laid off and maximum percentage of total laid off.
- Maximum laid off by 1 percentage based on total laid off.
- Maximum laid off by 1 percentage based on total laid off.
- Which company had the most lay offs?
etc.
