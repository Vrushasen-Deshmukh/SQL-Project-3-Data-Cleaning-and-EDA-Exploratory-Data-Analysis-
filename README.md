# SQL-Project-3-Data-Cleaning

# Overview
In this project we will be cleaning data in SQL. This data gives a snapshot of workforce reductions in different industries, geographic locations, and funding stages, highlighting trends in corporate downsizing and economic impact across the tech and startup ecosystems.

# Key Changes Made
- Removing Duplicates
- Standardizing the data
- Null Values or Blank Values
- Removing any columns

Then we did a bit of exploratory data analysis like:
- Maximum total laid off and maximum percentage of total laid off.
- Maximum laid off by 1 percentage based on total laid off.
- Maximum laid off by 1 percentage based on total laid off.
- Which company had the most lay offs?
etc.
